"""Guards on the curation plan and the manifest digest.

``is_dir()`` and ``is_file()`` follow links, so they answer about the TARGET when what
matters is the ENTRY. ``_is_shape_this_build_never_writes`` answers about shape when what
matters is origin. The reparse walk ran after ``resolve()``, so it answered about the
resolved path when what matters is the one that was written down. And the encoded-credential
detector answered "nothing found" when the truth was "nothing looked".

R1 the chain check ran too late -- ``_resolve_prompt_path`` resolved before checking, and
   resolve IS the traversal: on Windows following a reparse point that names a share is the
   outbound SMB probe with its NTLM exchange, and resolve also COLLAPSES the links, so a walk
   placed after it can never see one. The previous version passed its own tests only because
   they called it directly with an unresolved path, which is not what the call site passes.

R2 the redactor fallback -- encoded detection vanished silently when ``kiro_crew`` was not
   importable, which is the documented standalone mode.

R3 empty directories -- verified by neither the top-level name check, the shape check, nor
   the file digest, then removed by the recursive delete.

R4 a symlinked output root -- ``is_dir()`` accepted a link to a directory, so the build
   created and deleted inside the link's target.

R5 the report write -- truncated whatever was at ``<out>.smc-bundle.json``.

R6 (Opus) ``read_plan`` -- ``UnicodeDecodeError`` is a ``ValueError``, neither an ``OSError``
   nor a ``JSONDecodeError``, so a plan that is not valid UTF-8 escaped the handler.
