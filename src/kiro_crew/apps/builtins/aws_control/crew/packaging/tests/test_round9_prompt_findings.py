"""Two findings on the prompt reader, both raised by GPT and Opus independently.

V1 the pre-resolution walk ran only on the RELATIVE branch, so ``file:///abs/path`` reached
   ``resolve()`` with nothing having looked at its components. What that costs is Windows-only
   and narrow: resolving a reparse point that names a SHARE is the outbound SMB probe with its
   NTLM exchange, and the UNC gate above only sees a share written literally in the target.

   The first attempt walked the absolute path and refused every redirect. That reddened
   ``test_a_symlink_to_a_legitimate_persona_still_works`` and four more, because a symlink at
   the prompt path is a SUPPORTED case -- the design permits a persona outside the agents
   directory and protects it by checking the RESOLVED target against the sensitive-path fence.
   So the refusal is scoped to the one thing the target check cannot catch: a redirect that
   names a share, read with ``readlink``, which does not traverse.

V2 the read was unbounded. The prompt is inlined into ``agent.json``, so its bytes are held in
   memory, hashed and shipped -- and the path comes from the crew's agent spec, which makes the
   size someone else's choice.
