"""A skill rewritten between approval and copy must not reach the bundle.

``verify()`` compares the signed plan's pin against a hash taken at ENUMERATION time.
``_copy_skill`` then reads the source directory again. Those are two moments, and the
skills root is writable in between, so the bundle could carry bytes nobody reviewed
while still being a signed bundle -- the one outcome the signature exists to prevent.

The staged copy is therefore re-hashed against the pin. The second test here is the
one that matters for correctness rather than security: the copy deliberately DROPS
binary assets, so a naive staged-vs-pin comparison refuses every skill carrying an
image. The first version of this check did exactly that.
