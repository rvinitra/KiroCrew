"""The two Windows-only ``kiro_crew.hooks`` imports refuse rather than crash.

Both sit inside an ``os.name == "nt"`` branch, so the crash they would cause is reachable
only on Windows in the standalone venv the module documents -- the one environment where
``kiro_crew`` is not importable. A ``ModuleNotFoundError`` there escapes as an uncaught
traceback mid-build, past every handler that would have cleaned up.

Fail closed rather than skip, which is the opposite of the agent-spec fence. The difference
is what each question is for: the spec fence asks "is this path sensitive", which a coarse
local list can answer well enough to be worth asking. These ask "would resolving this path
reach a host over SMB", and an unanswerable version of that is not permission to resolve it
anyway.
