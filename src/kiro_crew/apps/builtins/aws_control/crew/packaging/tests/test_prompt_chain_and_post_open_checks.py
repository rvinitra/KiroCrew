"""The prompt path's chained-redirect and post-open checks.

Y1 the UNC check read only the FIRST hop, so link -> link -> share was open: the first
   ``readlink`` returns a local path, the test says no, and ``resolve()`` then follows the rest
   of the chain to the share. One hop is not a fence when hops compose.

Y2 the lstat walk judges paths and the open resolves one, so there is a window between them.
   A descriptor walk closes it and this platform cannot do one. The post-open identity check
   does not close it either -- it turns "the checks were advisory" into "a swap before the open
   is detected", which is a smaller claim and the honest one.
