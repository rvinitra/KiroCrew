"""The four findings on the head that carried the previous round's security fixes.

Two of them were introduced BY those fixes, which is the part worth recording: hardening a
path-handling site with ``dir_fd`` and ``O_NOFOLLOW`` moved the failure rather than removing
it, and neither the suite nor I noticed until the review read the new code.

R1 ``_dir_fd_supported`` -- ``_write_marker_exclusive``, ``_marker_is_ours`` and
   ``_open_root_nofollow`` all reached ``os.O_DIRECTORY`` unconditionally. The attribute
   does not exist on Windows, so every Windows build raised ``AttributeError`` before doing
   any work. ``_open_nofollow_under`` had asked the platform question inline since before
   this round; the three new functions did not ask at all.

R2 the directory case -- ``os.unlink`` cannot remove a directory, so a pre-existing
   ``<out>.staging.owned/`` raised ``IsADirectoryError``. It raised AFTER ``staging.mkdir``,
   leaving a traceback and a staging tree nothing cleaned up.

F3 ``_write_nofollow`` -- the marker got the no-follow write last round and the
   machine-readable report did not, though both are paths derived from ``--out`` in a
   directory this build does not own. One shared function now, so the two cannot drift.

F4 the shared fence -- when ``kiro_crew.security`` is not importable the code falls back to a
   local denylist. It refuses the external-prompt reference outright rather than judging it
   by the weaker check.
