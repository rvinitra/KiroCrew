"""The writer's parent check, and the chain walk to the spec.

W1 the marker read opened its parent OUTSIDE the guard, so ``--out new/nested/bundle`` -- a
   path whose parent does not exist yet -- raised an unhandled ``FileNotFoundError`` out of a
   function whose entire job is to answer yes or no. No parent means no marker, which is False.

W2 the empty-directory check exempted all of ``_STAGING_OWNED_TOP_LEVEL``, and four of those
   five entries are FILE names. So an operator's own empty directory called ``agent.json`` or
   ``manifest.json`` was exempted and then removed by the recursive delete -- the exemption
   for the one directory this build leaves empty was written wide enough to cover four names
   it should never have covered.
